# llm
This is the sart of my llm projetcs ;
currently there are 2 projects 
1 ."chatbot_gguf" is a jupyter notebook run locally on my pc based off the codellama-7b-instruct.Q2_K.gguf model .Its supposed to generate python code for a text prompt provided .As shown in the results for it however , it was highly inaccurate which brings me to my second project which is part of a tutorial:-
2 ."finetune_llama2" is a colab project aiming to use a free T4 gpu to finetune llama , currently im in the process of finetuning it and have already prepared the dataset under the header of "finetune_llama_dataset" the conext taken is quite small to decrease my idle time ,and the dataset values have been filtered .
